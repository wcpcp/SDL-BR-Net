this is the code of 'A NewStrategy for Retinal Vessel Segmentation based on Semi-dilation supervised Learning and Boundary Reconstruction', accepted by 2024 IEEE 7th International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence (PRAI)

in the project, there are three code called '_dgt', 'tuning', '_decompose' and '_MIM', whitch means the training with dilated supervised learning, two state training with boundary reconstructing, decompose module and training with MIM（Masked Image Modeling）

the network is in the models
